# Lab: AWS: Events

## Overview

Using only AWS Services: SQS, SNS, and client applications, create a cloud version of the CAPS system.

## Feature Tasks & Requirements

Refer to the [CAPS System Overview](../../apps-and-libraries/caps/README.md) for a complete review of the application, including Business and Technical requirements along with the development roadmap.

### Required Services

1. SNS Topic (FIFO): **pickup** which will receive all pickup requests from vendors.
1. SQS Queue (FIFO): **packages** which will contain all delivery requests from vendors, in order of receipt.
   - Subscribe this queue to the **pickup** topic so all pickups are ordered.
1. SQS Queue (Standard) for each vendor (named for the vendor) which will contain all delivery notifications from the drivers.

### Operations

#### Vendors:

- Vendors will post "pickup" messages containing delivery information into the SNS **pickup** topic.
  - `{ orderId: 1234, customer: "Jane Doe", vendorUrl: queueUrl}`
  - Note the `queueUrl` -- this refers to the AWS URL of the vendor's specific SQS Standard Queue.
- Pickup requests should be moved into a SQS FIFO Queue called **packages** for the drivers automatically.
  - (Make the packages queue a subscriber to the pickup topic).
- Vendors should separately subscribe to their personal SQS Standard Queue and periodically poll the queue to see delivery notifications.

#### Drivers:

- Drivers will poll the SQS **packages** queue and retrieve the delivery orders (messages) in order.
- After a time (e.g. 5 seconds), drivers will post a message to the Vendor specific SQS Standard Queue using the `queueUrl` specified in the order object.

## Implementation Notes

Work in a non-main branch in a new repository called "caps-cloud".

Once you have the appropriate queues and topics setup at SNS and SQS, you'll need some NodeJS applications running to get the system started.

1. `vendor.js` should be an SQS Subscriber
   - Connect it to the pickup topic by using it's URL/ARN
     - Set it up to produce a new message to the "pickup" topic every few seconds, simulating an order
       - The order id and customer name can be randomized
       - Include the URL to the vendor's personal delivery queue
   - Connect it to their own vendor queue by using it's URL
   - As drivers deliver, this app will continually poll the queue, retrieve them, and log details out to the console
   - You should be able to disconnect this app, and see deliveries that happened while the app was not running
1. `driver.js`
   - Connect to the **pickup** queue and get only the next package
   - Wait a random number of seconds
   - Post a message to the Vendor's "delivered" Queue (using the supplied URL in the order/message) to alert them of the delivery
   - Repeat until the queue is empty

> You should eventually be able to have multiple drivers and vendors wired up and acting in concert
