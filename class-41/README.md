### Using React Native and Expo to start an app

- [React Native Docs](https://reactnative.dev/)
- [Expo Docs](https://docs.expo.io/)
- [How to Create Your First App](https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/create-your-first-app/)

Useful Commands:
- `npx expo start` if working solo.
- `npx expo start --tunnel` if collaborating (somone on another device will run your code).

This will open up the Expo app runner, which allows you to run your app on a real device, or a simulator.
