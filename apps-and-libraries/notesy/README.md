# Notesy

A terminal based (CLI) application allowing users to easily create and manage a list of categorized notes

## Business Requirements

Using only the terminal, a user should be able to perform the following actions:

- List the notes in the database
  - All Notes: `node notes.js --list`
  - Notes in a category: `node notes.js --list school`

- Add a note to the database.
  - i.e. `node notes.js --add "This is fun" --category school

- Users should be able to delete a single note
  - `node notes.js --delete id`

## Technical Requirements

The application will be created with the following overall architecture and methodologies

1. Node.js
   - Custom Modules to handle the application logic
     - `input.js` will:
       - Parse the users' input
       - Map that to a command (i.e. add, delete)
       - Identify the data to give to the command (i.e. the note text)
     - `notes.js` will take a command + it's data and execute it
       - `add`, `delete`, `list`
   - Third party modules to handle common cases
     - Command Line input parsing using a node/npm library
     - MongoDB persistence using Mongoose
1. ES6 Classes
1. Persistence using a MongoDB Database (NoSQL)
1. Mongoose Schemas to define and model the data for MongoDB
   - `lib/model/notes-schema.js` will define the data for a note
1. Abstracted Data Models representing the MongoDB Collections
   - `lib/model/notes-collection.js` will be used by `notes.js` save/delete/query the database
1. Test Driven Development, using Jest
   - Tests will be runnable locally
   - Tests will auto-execute (CI) in your repo using GitHub actions
   - Tests will use a 3rd party library called `supergoose` to "mock" the MongoDB running database
1. Documented Code using JSDoc
1. Deployment via NPM

## Development Process, Milestones

1. **Phase 1: Application Setup**
   - Basic Input & Output from the command line, with flags and arguments
1. **Phase 2: Testing and Engineering**
   - Uses Classes and Object Orientation
   - Uses TDD Practices
   - Integrates with an online CI framework
1. **Phase 3: Persistence**
   - Notes may be assigned a category and will be saved in a database
   - Notes may be viewed as a list
   - Notes my be deleted
1. **Phase 4: Fit and Finish**
   - Data Models are tuned
   - App is Fully Tested
   - App is Fully Documented
   - `Notesy` is Deployed to NPM and Installable
