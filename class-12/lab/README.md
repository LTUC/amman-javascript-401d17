# LAB: Socket.io

**CAPS Phase 2:** Continue working on a multi-day build of our delivery tracking system, creating an event observable over a network with Socket.io.

In this phase, we'll be moving away from using Node Events for managing a pool of events, instead refactoring to using the Socket.io libraries.  This allows communication between Server and Client applications.

The intent here is to build the data services that would drive a suite of applications where we can see pickups and deliveries in real-time.

## Before you begin

Refer to *Getting Started*  in the [lab submission instructions](../../../reference/submission-instructions/labs/README.md) for complete setup, configuration, deployment, and submission instructions.

> Building off of your previous day's branch, create a new branch for today called 'socket.io' and continue to work in your 'caps' repository.

## Business Requirements

Refer to the [CAPS System Overview](../../apps-and-libraries/caps/README.md) for a complete review of the application, including Business and Technical requirements along with the development roadmap.

## Phase 2 Requirements

In Phase 2, we'll be changing the underlying networking implementation of our CAPS system from using node events to using a library called Socket.io so that clients can communicate over a network.  Socket.io manages the connection pool for us, making broadcasting much easier to operate, and works well both on the terminal (between servers) and with web clients.

The core functionality we've already built remains the same. The difference in this phase is that we'll be creating a networking layer. As such, the user stories that speak to application functionality remain unchanged, but our developer story changes to reflect the work needed for refactoring.

- As a vendor, I want to alert the system when I have a package to be picked up.
- As a driver, I want to be notified when there is a package to be delivered.
- As a driver, I want to alert the system when I have picked up a package and it is in transit.
- As a driver, I want to alert the system when a package has been delivered.
- As a vendor, I want to be notified when my package has been delivered.

And as developers, here is our updated story relevant to the above.

- **As a developer, I want to create network event driven system using Socket.io so that I can write code that responds to events originating from both servers and client applications**

## Technical Requirements / Notes

In order to switch from Node Events to Socket.io, the refactoring process will involve changes to each application to use the core features of Socket.io.

### Overview

The goal of this lab is to create a [**namespaced** Socket.io](https://socket.io/docs/v4/namespaces#Custom-namespaces) event server, and to configure **Vendor** and **Driver** Client Modules.

- The Socket Server will create a namespace of `caps` that will receive all CAPS event traffic.
- Each **Vendor** and **Driver** Client will connect to the `caps` namespace.
- The server will emit specific events to each `socket` that is listening for their designated events from the Global Event Pool defined in the Server.
- Each **Vendor** will only *emit* and *listen* for specific events based on their `Vendor ID`.  This will be managed by [rooms](https://socket.io/docs/v3/rooms/index.html) within Socket.io.
- Each **Driver** will "pick up" a package when the vendor notifies the Server that an "order" is ready and simulate "in-transit" and "delivered" events.

The expected output of the 3 running applications is the same as it was in Phase 2.

> Note: this is the heart of refactoring. The end result **appears** to be the same even after you've made a holistic change on the underlying code to be cleaner and faster. As developers, we want to do great work without changing the users' experience.

### Proposed File Structure

> Note:  The structure below shows both socket clients and the socket server in the same repo.  This is for learning and grading convenience, not a requirement.  Realistically, the socket server and each of the socket clients could be independent applications and repos.

### Global Event Pool (HUB)

1. Use the `socket.io` npm package to configure an event Server that can be started at a designated port using node.
   - Accept connections on a namespace called `caps`, and configure `socket` objects from clients.
   - Ensure that client `sockets` are connecting to their appropriate `room` if specified.

1. Configure a Global Event Pool that every client `socket` should listen for:
    - `pickup` - this will be broadcast to all sockets except the  sender.
    - `in-transit` - this will be emitted only to **Vendors** that have joined the appropriate room.
    - `delivered` - this will be be emitted only to **Vendors** that have joined the appropriate room.
    > NOTE: You may need to create an extra event here that allows clients to `join` rooms.

### Vendor Client Application

1. Connects to the CAPS Application Server using `socket.io-client`:
   - Make sure your module connects to the `caps` namespace.
   - Use the  store name `1-206-flowers` to simulate a single vendor
   - Upon connection, use the store name as a vendor id to join a room.

1. Upon connection, simulate new customer orders:
   - Create a payload object with your store name, order id, customer name, and address.
   - Emit that message to the CAPS server with an event called `pickup`.
   - Emit in a `setInterval()`  to simulate multiple orders and observe system functionality.

1. Listen for the `delivered` event coming in from the CAPS server.
   - Console log: `Thank you for your order <customer-name>`.

1. Optionally, you can  exit the application using `process.exit()` or `clearInterval(<interval-id>)` within a `setTimeout()` to simulate multiple orders and then stop.

### Driver Client Application

1. Connects to the CAPS Application Server using `socket.io-client`:
   - Make sure this module connects to the `caps` namespace.

1. Once connected, the Driver client module should listen for any appropriate events from the Server:
   - When a `pickup` is emitted from the Server, simulate all specified Driver behaviors.

1. Simulate the following events and emit payloads to the CAPS Application Server upon receiving a "pickup" event:
   - **`in-transit`**
     - Log "picking up `payload.id`" to the console.
     - emit an `in-transit` event to the CAPS server with the payload.
   - **`delivered`**
     - emit a `delivered` event to the CAPS server with the payload.

When running, the vendor and driver consoles should show their own logs. Additionally, the CAPS server should be logging everything.

### Notes

- You will need to start your servers up in the right order so that you can visually test things out.  Consider adjusting interval and timeouts in order to clearly see behavior.

1. `caps` - needs to be up so that it can accept and re-emit events.
2. `driver` - needs a running server to connect to ands listen for all incoming orders from the Vendor.
3. `vendor` - needs to connect to a running server so that it can hear events and emit orders.

### Stretch Goal

Write a separate app using express, with a single route: POST `/pickup` that sends a JSON object with the following properties:

```json
{
  "store": "<STORE_NAME>",
  "orderId": "<ORDER_ID>",
  "customer": "<FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME>",
  "address": "<CITY, STATE>"
 }
```

When that route is hit, have the express server trigger the socket server with the `pickup` event with the attached JSON payload. This should kick off the same series of events that the `vendor` application was triggering before, now using a web request instead of a terminal process that triggers events automatically.

Assuming your small api server runs on port 3001, the form in the test app will hit that route if you have done this step.

### Testing

- Write unit tests for each event handler function (not event triggers themselves).
- Use jest [spies](https://jestjs.io/docs/jest-object#jestfnimplementation) and/or [mock functionality](https://jestjs.io/docs/manual-mocks) to assert that your handlers were called and ran as expected. 
- For our use case, was `console.log()` and  `.emit()` called with the expected arguments?
