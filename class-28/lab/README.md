# LAB - Component Lifecycle / `useEffect()` Hook

**RESTy Phase 3:** Connect RESTy with APIs, running live requests.

## Before you begin

Refer to *Getting Started*  in the [lab submission instructions](../../../reference/submission-instructions/labs/README.md) for complete setup, configuration, deployment, and submission instructions.

> Continue working in your 'resty' repository, in a branch called 'effect-hook'.

## Business Requirements

Refer to the [RESTy System Overview](../../apps-and-libraries/resty/README.md) for a complete review of the application, including Business and Technical requirements along with the development roadmap.

## Phase 3 Requirements

In phase 3, we will be connecting RESTy to live APIs, fetching and displaying remote data. Our primary focus will be to service *GET* requests.

The following user stories detail the major functionality for this phase of the project.

- As a user, I want to enter the URL to an API and issue a GET request so that I can retrieve it's data.
- As a user, I want to see the results returned from an API request in my browser in a readable format.

Application Flow:

- User enters an API URL.
- Chooses a REST Method.
- Clicks the  "Go" button.
- Application fetches data from the URL given, with the method specified.
- Displays the response headers and results separately.
- Both headers and results should be "pretty printed" JSON.

> One possible design/layout. Please use your judgement and taste in styling your version of this application.

## Technical Requirements / Note

> Extend your application to include the ability to send http requests and display response data, when the `<Form />` component experiences a submission event.

1. Refactor application methods to allow for browser side HTTP requests to be sent.
   - Your implementation should allow the user to set a url, method, and request body.
1. Make sure all relevant request and response data is displayed to the User.

Suggested approach:

- `<Form />` component, `onSubmit()` sends the user's entries to the `<App />` via method sent in through props.
- `<App />` does a check on the request data from the form and updates the request variable in state with the `url`, `method`, and potentially the `body`.
- `<App />` has an effect hook that's looking for changes to the request variable in state, and in response, runs the API request with the new request options from state.
- `<App />` updates state with the results of the API Request.
- `<Results />` sees the new API data as a prop and renders the JSON. The JSON data should include count, pagination data, and results.

Note: update your `<Results />` component to use a 3rd party component to "pretty print" the JSON in a color-coded, user-friendly format.

## Proposed File Structure

In this proposal:
- Utilize [Airbnb React/JSX Style Guide](https://airbnb.io/javascript/react/) conventions.
- Unit tests are placed in the component directory (testing one file only).
- Integration tests are placed in the `__tests__` directory (testing more than one file).

## Tests

- Utilize the React Testing Library framework installed with CRA.
- Assert that upon form submission the resulting data will be rendered in the output area.
- You will need to "mock" the API request with React Testing Library.
  - install `msw`.
  - Note the [example here.](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/example-intro/#full-example)
    - This shows how to use the `msw` package to setup a fake server that returns fake data in your tests so that you can run tests without having to call an actual API.

## Stretch Goals

Add support for all REST methods.

- **GET** a single record by ID.
- **DELETE** a single record by ID.
- **PUT** a single record by ID.
  - Requires the addition of a text area where you can type in the JSON body for the update.
- **POST** to create a new record.
  - Requires the addition of a text area where you can type in the JSON body for the new record.

## Assignment Submission Instructions
